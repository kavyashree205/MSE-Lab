Differences between protocols and subclasses.

																			Protocols-

1. A protocol is a list of method declarations that is not bound to any one class. The methods are not implemented in the protocol; instead, classes conform to or adopt a protocol and within those classes the methods are implemented.

2. Purpose of using a protocol
-To declare methods for others to implement.
-To declare the public interface to a class while hiding the nature of the class itself.
-To mark similarities between classes that are not part of the same inheritance tree.
-It helps in avoiding the complexities of subclassing, similar to the way categories do, but in a different manner.

3. Advantage
It helps to implement polymorphism. Without protocols, users of the class would have to subclass the original class, deal with any issues, and override the original methods. 

4. Example 
@protocol protocol-name

@end

																			Subclasses-

1. A subclass is a class definition that inherits the definition of a superclass. All of the methods that are defined in the superclass are automatically defined in the subclass. 

2. Purpose of using a subclass
Subclassing is for when we want to inherit the traits and behaviors of the superclass while modifying it in some way. 

3. Advantage
Subclassing is more useful if we want to alter the behavior of only certain instances, and retain the original method for others.

4. Example
If there is a class called classname and a subclass called subclassname :

@interface subclassname : classname {
// instance variables that subclassname has but classname lacks 
}
// methods that subclassname has and classname may or may not go here. If both have it, subclassname's implementation override's classname's so long as an instance of subclassname is references.
